IDEA:
A Ball floating on water. whenever it is being pushed, it triggers a light feedback.
after 5 straight strong pushes, the ball increases the low bar of the minimum required push to get a feedback.
eventually the goal is to have the user to exercise the push as many times, motivated to see the feedback.
